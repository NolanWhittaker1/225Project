# Overview
This project presents a solver for the popular 15 puzzle game, tasked with solving random boards ranging from 3x3 to 9x9 within a specified time frame. The solver employs the A* algorithm with three distinct heuristics: Manhattan Distance, Linear Conflict, and Hamming Distance. The primary goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these heuristics for different board sizes to achieve accurate and efficient solving times.

# Features
A Algorithm:* Utilizes the A* algorithm for efficient and optimal pathfinding in solving the 15 puzzle.

## Heuristics:
Manhattan Distance: Measures the total distance between each tile and its target position.
Linear Conflict: Incorporates conflicts arising from tiles in the same row or column.
Hamming Distance: Quantifies the number of misplaced tiles.
Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation of heuristics on random boards of varying sizes.
